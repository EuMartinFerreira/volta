# Facilitating compliance with PCI DSS

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. Volta can be a significant technical component in helping an organization meet several PCI DSS requirements, particularly those related to protecting stored cardholder data (CHD) and managing cryptographic keys.

**How Volta Facilitates PCI DSS Compliance:**

1.  **Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data**
    *   **Req 3.4: Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs) by using one of the following approaches: one-way hashes based on strong cryptography, truncation, index tokens and pads (securely stored), or strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures.**
        *   **Volta's Contribution:**
            *   **Strong Cryptography (`Encrypt`/`Decrypt`):** Volta directly provides the "strong cryptography" mechanism. Applications can use Volta's `Encrypt` function to encrypt Primary Account Numbers (PANs) before storing them.
            *   **Associated Key Management:** Volta provides robust key management for the Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) used to encrypt PANs. This includes secure generation (via derivation), storage (encrypted at rest within the vault), controlled access, and rotation (`RotateKey`). This is critical because the strength of the encryption relies on the protection of the keys.
    *   **Req 3.5: Document and implement procedures to protect keys used to secure stored cardholder data against disclosure and misuse.**
        *   **Volta's Contribution:**
            *   **Secure Key Storage:** Keys (DEKs or Key Encryption Keys - KEKs, if used in a more complex hierarchy) can be stored as secrets within Volta's encrypted vault.
            *   **Access Control:** Volta's API-driven access, `tenantID` isolation, and the `UseSecret` pattern ensure that keys are only disclosed to authorized application components with a legitimate need.
            *   **Audit Trails (`audit.Logger`):** All access and management operations for these keys can be logged, aiding in demonstrating protection against misuse.
    *   **Req 3.6: Fully document and implement all key-management processes and procedures for cryptographic keys used for encryption of cardholder data...** This includes requirements for:
        *   **Req 3.6.1 (Secure key generation):** Volta uses cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (via Go's `crypto/rand`) for its internal key derivation, ensuring strong keys.
        *   **Req 3.6.2 (Secure key distribution):** Keys are distributed programmatically via Volta's APIs, minimizing manual handling. Access is controlled.
        *   **Req 3.6.3 (Secure key storage):** DEKs are encrypted at rest within the Volta vault, protected by a master derivation key derived from the tenant passphrase. `memguard` adds in-memory protection.
        *   **Req 3.6.4 (Periodic key changes):** Volta's `RotateKey` function directly supports the rotation of DEKs used to encrypt CHD. The application is responsible for scheduling and re-encrypting data with new keys.
        *   **Req 3.6.5 (Retirement or replacement of old/weak keys):** Rotating keys via `RotateKey` and ensuring old keys are no longer used for new encryption, combined with `DeleteSecret` for any explicitly stored old keys, helps meet this.
        *   **Req 3.6.6 (Split knowledge/dual control if manual):** Volta aims to minimize manual key management, but if a KEK managed outside Volta is stored *as a secret* in Volta, then Volta is part of the protection mechanism.
        *   **Req 3.6.7 (Prevention of unauthorized substitution):** Volta's internal integrity checks and the overall vault encryption help prevent unauthorized key substitution.
        *   **Req 3.6.8 (Requirement for key custodians):** While Volta is software, the operational procedures around managing tenant passphrases (which unlock the Volta vault) would involve defining custodians.

2.  **Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications**
    *   **Req 6.3: Incorporate information security throughout the software development life cycle.**
        *   **Volta's Contribution:** By providing a ready-made, security-focused library for secret and key management, Volta encourages developers to build security in from the start, rather than trying to bolt it on later or invent insecure custom solutions for critical functions.
    *   **Req 6.5: Address common coding vulnerabilities in software-development processes...** (e.g., secure credential storage).
        *   **Volta's Contribution:** Directly addresses secure credential storage (for database passwords, API keys to payment processors, etc.) and cryptographic key storage, helping to avoid insecure practices like hardcoding secrets or storing them in plaintext config files.

3.  **Requirement 7: Restrict Access to Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know**
    *   **Volta's Contribution:**
        *   **Least Privilege for Secrets:** Applications can be designed to retrieve credentials or encryption keys from Volta only when necessary for a specific operation, and the `UseSecret` function further helps scope this access.
        *   **`tenantID` Isolation:** In multi-tenant systems, ensures that application logic for one merchant/entity cannot access the cryptographic keys or credentials of another.

4.  **Requirement 8: Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components**
    *   **Req 8.2: In addition to assigning a unique ID, ensure proper user-authentication management...**
        *   **Volta's Contribution (Indirect):** While Volta doesn't manage end-user or system identities itself, it protects the secrets (like API keys, service account credentials) that *are* used for authentication between system components within the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). The tenant passphrase acts as an authentication factor to unlock the vault.

5.  **Requirement 10: Track and Monitor All Access to Network Resources and Cardholder Data**
    *   **Req 10.2: Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events... (e.g., 10.2.1 All individual user accesses to cardholder data, 10.2.4 Invalid logical access attempts, 10.2.5 Use of and changes to identification and authentication mechanisms...)**
        *   **Volta's Contribution:**
            *   **`audit.Logger`:** Volta's audit system can log every attempt to access a secret (which could be a key for CHD or credentials to access CHD systems), successful or failed. It logs key rotations, secret creations, deletions, etc. This provides a crucial audit trail for activity related to the *keys and credentials that protect CHD*.

**Broader Contributions to a PCI DSS Compliant Environment:**

*   **Reducing Scope:** While Volta itself would likely reside within the CDE or be a critical component supporting services in the CDE, by effectively managing encryption keys, it can help in strategies to reduce the scope of a PCI DSS assessment if CHD is properly encrypted and keys are managed according to PCI DSS requirements. For instance, PANs encrypted by Volta and stored in a database might allow that database to be considered "out of scope" for certain PCI DSS requirements if the keys are robustly protected elsewhere (e.g., within a separate, secure Volta instance or HSM). *This requires careful architectural consideration and QSA validation.*
*   **Defense in Depth:** Volta adds a strong layer of defense for critical cryptographic material and secrets, complementing other security controls like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and secure configurations.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Volta is a Tool, Not a Full Solution:** PCI DSS compliance involves a holistic approach covering policies, procedures, physical security, network security, and more. Volta provides strong technical capabilities for specific requirements but doesn't make an organization PCI DSS compliant on its own.
*   **Application & Environmental Responsibility:** The security of Volta's vault heavily relies on the security of the tenant passphrase and the environment in which the application using Volta runs. Secure coding practices for the application itself, OS hardening, network segmentation, and proper management of the tenant passphrase are all critical.
*   **QSA Validation:** The effectiveness of Volta as part of a PCI DSS compliance strategy would need to be assessed and validated by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).

In summary, Volta provides essential technical building blocks—particularly around strong cryptography, secure key lifecycle management, access control to sensitive data, and audit logging—that directly help organizations satisfy several prescriptive requirements within PCI DSS, especially those in Requirements 3, 7, 8 and 10, and support the overall goal of protecting cardholder data.
