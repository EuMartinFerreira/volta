## Installation

To install Volta, you can use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/EuMartinFerreira/volta
```

Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can check the installation by running:

```bash
go version
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use Volta in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/EuMartinFerreira/volta"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the library
    vault, err := volta.NewVault("your-encryption-key")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error initializing vault: %v", err)
    }

    // Store a secret
    err = vault.Store("exampleSecret", "your-secret-value")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error storing secret: %v", err)
    }

    // Retrieve a secret
    secret, err := vault.Retrieve("exampleSecret")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error retrieving secret: %v", err)
    }
    log.Printf("Retrieved secret: %s", secret)
}
```

This example shows how to initialize Volta, store a secret, and retrieve it. For more detailed examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/EuMartinFerreira/volta/releases).

## Key Concepts

### Encryption

Volta uses state-of-the-art encryption algorithms to protect your data. The library abstracts the complexities of encryption, allowing you to focus on your application logic.

### Key Derivation

Key derivation is crucial for generating secure keys from passwords. Volta implements best practices to ensure that keys are strong and unique.

### Audit Logging

Audit logging allows you to track all interactions with sensitive data. This feature is essential for compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

Volta is designed to support multi-tenant applications. This means that you can manage secrets for different clients or departments without risking data exposure.
